# UCI_heart_disease
The following uses a random forest approach to predict heart disease from a number of features. These data are available on Kaggle (see ReadMe). This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
